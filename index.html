        <h2>LAWASA CITY PUNE</h2>
        <P>
            Lavasa is a private,planned city built near pune.it is stylistically based on the
            italian town portofino, with a street and several buildings bearing the name of that town.A 25,000 acres
            project being developed by hcc, this as-yet-incomplete city has been controversial for multiple reasons
            including procurement of land,harm to the environment,and loans acquired through political corruption.
            Lavasa has established a pattern of promoting planned partnerships with prestigious, overseas institutions
            that do not ultimately see fruition. Oxford university had at one point associated itself with the project,
            but other, name-brand plans including future sports facilities have yet to be officially canceled.

        <h2>HINJEWADI IT PARK PUNE</h2>
        <p>
            hinjawadi, in the western metropolitan corridor of pune in maharashtra, india, is home to a huge chunk of
            global technology companies and start-ups within the rajiv gandhi infotech park, a large it and business
            park spread over 2,800 acres which was built by the maharashtra industrial development,earlier, hinjawadi
            was a village until the construction of the rajiv gandhi infotech park. today, it is one of the epicenters
            of it industry in india. to enhance the overall planning and development of hinjawadi area, it was brought
            under the jurisdiction of pmrda. initially, the state government was reluctant on the demands to bring the
            hinjawadi under the jurisdiction of either pmc or pcmc as this area needed special attention. currently, the
            rajiv gandhi infotech park is divided into three major phases with further phases planned. eventually, the
            hinjawadi industries association was laid out to provide a joint forum to all stakeholders based out of
            hinjawadi and nearby places.
